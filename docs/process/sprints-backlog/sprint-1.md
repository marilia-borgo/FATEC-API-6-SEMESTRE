# Sprint 1 Backlog


| Rank | Priority | User Story | Related Requirements | Estimate (Story Points) | Sprint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spike | - | As a geospatial data ingestion system, I want to process .gdb.zip files asynchronously and efficiently, so that I can provide cleaned and georeferenced data in the database for analysis and visualization. | - | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | High | As a Tecsys sales/technical consultant, I want to view a ranking table that calculates the Criticality Index (percentage deviation of DEC and FEC based on ANEEL limits) for each electrical set, so that I can quickly identify and prioritize which regions have the worst structural efficiency. | [`RF1-DATA-INGEST`](../requirements.md#rf1-data-ingest---ingestão-de-dados-regulatórios), [`RF2-ANALYTICS-CRIT`](../requisitos.md#rf2-analytics-crit---cálculo-de-criticidade-e-perdas) | 18 | 1 | 
| 2 | High | As a member of the sales/technical team, I want to view a bar chart ordered by the electrical sets with the highest SAM score, so that I can quickly know which regions have the highest priority for sensor deployment. | [`RF2-ANALYTICS-CRIT`](../requisitos.md#rf2-analytics-crit---cálculo-de-criticidade-e-perdas) | 10 | 1 |  
| 3 | High | As a member of the sales/technical team, I want to view a stacked bar chart comparing the absolute volume (in MWh) of Technical Losses (PT) and Non-Technical Losses (PNT) for each electrical set, in order to show the magnitude of the grid’s structural failures. | [`RF2-ANALYTICS-CRIT`](../requisitos.md#rf2-analytics-crit---cálculo-de-criticidade-e-perdas) | 10 | 1 |
| 4 | High | As a Tecsys sales/technical consultant, I want to view a ranking with the 10 electrical sets with the greatest medium-voltage extension (TAM), to demonstrate the points with the highest operational vulnerability. | [`RF1-DATA-INGEST`](../requirements.md#rf1-data-ingest---ingestão-de-dados-regulatórios), [`RF2-ANALYTICS-TAM`](../requirements.md#rf2-analytics-tam---dimensionamento-físico-tam) | 12 | 1 | 
| 5 | Medium | As a Tecsys sales/technical consultant, I want to view a georeferenced heatmap indicating the most critical circuits based on the Criticality Index, in order to justify investments in smart sensors. | [`RF4-MAPS-HEATMAP`](../requirements.md#rf4-maps-heatmap---mapas-de-calor-e-polígonos) | 8 | 2 |
